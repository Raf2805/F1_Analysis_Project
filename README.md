# Formula 1 Championship Analysis (2020-2023)

## Project Overview

This project explores Formula 1 racing data from 2020 to 2023, analyzing performance trends among constructors and drivers, the relationship between starting grids and final positions, and circuits that yield higher points on average. The analysis is designed to showcase data collection skills, statistical analysis, and effective visualization for insightful conclusions.

## Data Source

Data is obtained from the Ergast Motor Racing API:
- API URL: http://ergast.com/mrd/
- The API provides detailed historical data about races, driver standings, constructor standings, and more.

## Research Questions

1. **Constructor Performance:**  
   How do constructors compare in terms of total points across the seasons?

2. **Starting Grid vs. Finish Position:**  
   Is there a notable relationship between the starting grid position and the final race position?

3. **Circuit Analysis:**  
   Which circuits are associated with higher average points for drivers?

4. **Driver Progression:**  
   How have the top drivers' points evolved over the seasons 2020 to 2023?

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Data collection via the Ergast API using the Requests module
- Jupyter Notebook for an organized analysis workflow

## Files in this Repository

- `README.md`: Project overview, methodology, and research insights.
- `Project_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data collection, cleaning, visualization, and analysis code.
